`tsCeatures` is a simple R package for the computation of a few time-series features coded in C++ for scalability and efficiency. The name is a play on the `tsfeatures` naming convention in the time series software world. You can install `tsCeatures` from GitHub:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/tsCeatures")
```

## Core functionality

The main function of the package is `get_features` which automatically computes all features included in `tsCeatures`. This can be run in a one-liner:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
x <- rnorm(100)
outs <- get_features(x)
```

You can also calculate each of the features individually by directly calling their name:

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE}
ac_1(x)
```
