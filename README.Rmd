# tsCeatures <img src="man/figures/logo.png" align="right" width="120" />

R package for computation of some simple time-series features coded in C++ for efficiency and scalability.

The package name is a play on the `tsfeatures` naming convention in the time series software world and should not be taken seriously.

```{r, include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(
comment = NA, fig.width = 7, fig.height = 5, cache = FALSE)
```

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tsCeatures` from GitHub using the following:

```{r, eval = FALSE}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/tsCeatures")
```

## Computational performance

With features coded in C++, `tsCeatures` is highly computationally efficient. Computation time in seconds (log10 scaled) for a range of time-series lengths between `t = 10` and `t = 1000000` is presented below.

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE}
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(microbenchmark)
library(tsCeatures)

set.seed(123)
storage <- list()
lengths <- c(10^1, 10^2, 10^3, 10^4, 10^5, 10^6)

for(i in lengths){
  
  tmp <- c(cumsum(rnorm(i, mean = 0, sd = 1)))
  
  m <- summary(microbenchmark(get_features(tmp), times = 20, unit = "s"))
  
  mdat <- data.frame(m) %>%
    dplyr::select(c(mean)) %>%
    mutate(ts_length = i)
  
  storage[[i]] <- mdat
}

sims <- data.table::rbindlist(storage, use.names = TRUE)
```

```{r, message = FALSE, warning = FALSE, echo = FALSE, fig.keep = TRUE}
# Draw graphic

sims %>%
  ggplot() +
  geom_smooth(aes(x = ts_length, y = mean), formula = y ~ x, method = "lm", 
              se = FALSE, size = 1.15, colour = "#1f78b4") +
  geom_point(aes(x = ts_length, y = mean), size = 3.5, colour = "#1f78b4") +
  labs(x = "Time Series Length",
       y = "Computation Time (s)") +
  scale_x_log10(limits = c(1e1,1e6),
                breaks = scales::trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),
                labels = scales::trans_format("log10", scales::math_format(10^.x))) +
  scale_y_log10(breaks = scales::trans_breaks("log10", function(x) 10^x),
                labels = scales::trans_format("log10", scales::math_format(10^.x))) +
  theme_bw() +
  theme(panel.grid.minor = element_blank(),
        legend.position = "bottom",
        axis.text = element_text(size = 12))
```

## Notes

This package is a pretty low-fi and informal attempt at something interesting and is not intended as-yet to be a dedicated and useful feature set relative to existing sets and software packages.
