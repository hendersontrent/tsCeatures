# tsCeatures

R package for computation of some simple time-series features coded in C++ for efficiency and scalability.

## Installation

You can install the development version of `tsCeatures` from GitHub using the following:

```{r}
devtools::install_github("hendersontrent/tsCeatures")
```

## Notes

This package is a pretty low-fi attempt at something interesting and is not intended as-yet to be a dedicated and useful feature set relative to existing sets and software packages.
